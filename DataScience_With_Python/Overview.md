# DataScience With Python

* it is fundamentally an interdisciplinary subject
* Data Science is confluence of three skills:
  * Hacking Skills (Computer Science)
  * Mathematics & Statistics
  * Substantive Expertise (Domain Expertise)
* Machine Learning is confluence of two skills:
  * Hacking Skills
  * Mathematics & Statistics
* Python and R are two prominent programming languages to do data science.
* Python has the following popular modules for data processing
  * NumPy formanipulation of homogeneous array-based data
  * Pandas for manipulationof heterogeneous and labeled data
  * SciPy for common scientificcomputing tasks
  * Matplotlib for publication-quality visualizations
  * IPython for interactive execution and sharing of code
  * Scikit-Learnfor machine learning
